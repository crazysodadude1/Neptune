# super_boat
This project has an end goal of achieving a working small scale semi-autonomous or fully autonomous boat. 

The project milestones, with no associated timeline, is as follows(This is a working list, these milestones may, and probably will, be changed):

1. Accquire a complete list of needed hardware and their appropriate references to assist with communication.
1a. If possible, accquire the required hardware. Otherwise, placeholder files will be needed during the appropriate phase.
2. Create a hardware diagram of how each of the different components should work together. This will help with visualisation of the project on a hardware component level, as well as ensure the required physical connections are available
3. Create the necessary software from which the boat can run
4. Create a UI for the boat so that humans can still override and take manual control
5. Test Boat
